## About The Project

**CineReviewX** is an IMDB movie sentiment analysis project that classifies movie reviews into two categories: positive or negative. Using deep learning techniques, this project processes textual movie reviews to predict the sentiment behind them. By leveraging Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models, it analyzes large datasets of reviews, providing insights into how audiences emotionally react to films.

### Key Steps Involved
1. **Data Collection:** The project uses a dataset of movie reviews from IMDB, containing both positive and negative feedback from users.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** The raw text data is tokenized and converted into vectors using One-Hot Encoding, transforming the text into a numerical format suitable for analysis.

3. **Model Building:**  The model is constructed using the following layers:
   - **Embedding Layer:** Converts words into dense vector representations.
   - **SimpleRNN Layers:** Captures patterns in the sequence of words to understand sentiment.
   - **Dense Output Layer:** Uses a sigmoid activation function to output a probability value, classifying the sentiment as either positive (1) or negative (0).

4. **Model Training:**   The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset, utilizing appropriate optimization techniques to minimize loss and improve accuracy. The early stopping mechanism monitors validation loss and halts training when performance plateaus.

5. **Model Evaluation:** After training, the model is evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its performance on unseen data.

6. **Deployment:** A **Streamlit** web application is developed to allow users to input movie reviews and get real-time sentiment predictions.

### Key Features
- **Sentiment Classification**: Classifies movie reviews as Positive or Negative.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Prepares and cleans raw text for machine learning models.
- **Text Vectorization**: Converts raw text into numerical format using One-Hot Encoding.
- **Modeling**: Implements a Simple RNN for sentiment analysis.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measures model performance using accuracy.

 ## About the Data

The dataset contains a collection of IMDB movie reviews and their corresponding sentiment labels (positive or negative). It includes user reviews, movie ratings, and associated metadata for each review. The dataset is preprocessed to remove irrelevant information such as stop words, HTML tags, and special characters.

## Target Variable

The target variable for this project is **Sentiment** (either 1 for positive or 0 for negative), which is derived from the movie reviews. The model's goal is to predict the sentiment label based on the review text.

## Dataset Source Link

The dataset used in this project is publicly available on [Kaggle IMDB Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/). You can download it directly from there for local use or to train the models.
